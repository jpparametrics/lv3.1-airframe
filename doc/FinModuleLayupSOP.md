# Day One
## Calibration and Prep
1. Sand all inner surfaces of the brackets
2. Find the largest seam on the module (if one exists).
3. Pick the closest bulkhead clamp screw hole.
4. Put module on the rig.
5. Put a sandbag inside the module, about in the middle, to weigh the module down during the process.
6. Using a black sharpie (choose any color, but make sure to use that color when I say black), mark a line on the end of the ring in-line with the arc clamp hole chosen.
7. Rotate the module two bulkhead holes clockwise, mark a line on the end in-line with this hole with a red sharpie (any color other than the one you used before).
8. Repeat step 4, alternating black and red sharpies until you make it back to the first line.
 * The idea behind this is to indicate that the black lines are where the fins line up, and the red lines are used to line up the module with the notches on the jig.

9. Line up the inside edge of the ring with the inside edge of the front of the rig.
 * The idea is to line up the trailing end of the bracket with the inside edge of the ring module.
10. Line up two of the red lines with the notches on the rig.
  
11. Stick double-sided foam tape on the curved surface of the inside corner of a fin bracket.
12. Press the inside corner on the downward facing edge of the alignment surface of the rig, aligned with the inside edge of the module ring. This end is the bottom of the rocket.
13.Apply kapton tape around all outer module ring surfaces.
14. Move the alignment surfaces so the bracket is lightly pressed up against the module.
15. Draw a line on the module along the bottom edge of the bracket.
  
16. Back the alignment surface off and remove the module
17. Apply wide kapton tape directly underneath the marked line.
18. Tape a sheet wax paper on top of the existing kapton tape.
  * Make sure the wax paper is long enough to wrap around the bottom of the module.
19. Tape down all other edges of the wax paper.
20. Apply more wax paper as needed to span the entire length of the marked line/to wrap around the bottom of the module.
21. Reinsert the module into the jig.
22. Make sure that the module is clamped to the jig.
23. Sanity check! Make sure that the fin bracket doesn’t overlap with kapton tape.

## Layup:
24. Measure out a total of 100 g (50 of A and 50 of B) of epoxy for all surfaces. Instructions for epoxy on bottle.
  * Epoxy will get a little cloudy when fully mixed
25. Apply epoxy to the concave surface of the bracket.

26. Using the alignment surface, press the epoxied bracket onto the module where it was aligned before.
27. Hold a long piece of acrylic onto the curved surface of the bracket, underneath the alignment surfaces.
28. Firmly and evenly screw down the alignment surface bolts onto the piece of acrylic.

29. Wait at least 24 hours for curing.

# DAY 2/DAY 3/DAY 4:
## Calibration and Prep
30. MAKE SURE YOU HAVE GLOVES ON WHEN TOUCHING THE BRACKETS
31. Sand both faces of the fin, approximately the width of the fin backet, using water and sandpaper. Clean with IPA.
32. Carefully separate the alignment surface from the bracket. (Be careful taking out the module.)
  * Use a wedge of some sort to separate the foam tape from the alignment surface if necessary.
33.Remove the foam tape completely from the bracket.
34. Apply double-sided foam tape along the inside faces of TWO brackets.
  * For Day 4, it is in fact, only ONE bracket. Remove non-used alignment surface.
35. Stick the brackets on both alignment surfaces, aligning the brackets the same way as in step 9, but do not press down fully yet.

36. Rotate the module 120°. 
  * Line up the red line with the notch on the rig.
  * The orthogonal surface of the laid-up bracket should be facing downward and slightly above the new bracket.
  * For Day 3 and 4, the module will need to be taken off the rig to rotate
37. Repeat steps 10 through 16 for both sides.
  * Sandwich a fin between two brackets

38. Mark front end of fin on module (as reference)
39. Put Kapton tape along the module, the Kapton tape should be right underneath where the bracket goes
40. Tape a sheet of wax paper on top of the existing kapton tape.
  * Day 2: Make sure the wax paper is long enough to wrap around the module fully between the lines of kapton tape.
  * Day 3/4: Just let the wax paper dangle.
  * Day 4: Only one side is needed.
41. Tape down all other edges of the wax paper.
42. Apply more wax paper as needed to span the entire length of the marked line/to wrap between the lines.
43. Wipe down the exposed faces of the module with isopropyl alcohol 
44. Tape the top face of the fin with masking tape so you move the fin up and down like a flap so the fin stays in the same position.

## Layup:
45. Rotate the module slightly back, giving enough clearance between the old a new bracket for a fin.
46. Measure out a total of 100 g (50 of A and 50 of B) of epoxy for all surfaces. Instructions for epoxy on bottle.
  * Epoxy will get a little cloudy when fully mixed
  * Somewhat less is needed is needed for Day 4
47. Apply epoxy to the exposed surfaces of the brackets.

48. Put bracket into position onto alignment surface
49. Apply epoxy to new bracket mating side of fin
  * Have a shop towel soaked with iso ready to wipe off dripping epoxy

50. Fold fin down onto new bracket and hold firm
51. Epoxy remaining side of fin and the old bracket mating face

52. Rotate fin can until flush with fin
53. Press alignment surface down onto module
54. Line up edges of old to new bracket
55. Sandwich fin as firmly as possible between the two brackets
56. And clamp! 

57. Screw in the sides with the hex wrench
58. Cinch the bracket down with the strap and ratchet. 
59.Seal any extra space between the bracket and the fin with leftover epoxy
60. Put the acrylic on the bottom of the curved part of the bracket and press firm with screws
  * Put wax paper underneath the acrylic 
61. Repeat Day 1 layup for the second bracket
  * Not needed on Day 4

62. Wait at least 24 hours for curing.

# Post Layup Touch Ups:
* Fill any gaps between bracket and fin or bracket and module with epoxy
* Sand, sand, sand
* Clean with isopropyl
